            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Curteous Reader, grace, mercy, and peace.</head>
            <p>DEarly beloved, you may be pleaſed to remember, that not long ſince I ſet forth a Treatiſe under this Title, <hi>The worldlings look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe,</hi> In which I promiſed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this preſent Parable; And ſeeing promiſe is counted a due debt, though I have ſtayed long, before I have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that which I then undertooke, yet at laſt, as you ſee, I am as good as my word, and now tender you paiment. In this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcourſe, I have laid open the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate of all Hypocrites, who have Chriſt rife in their mouths, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would ſeeme better than any; when
<pb facs="tcp:17173:6"/> as indeed they are worſe than many, for God accountes a devout Hypocrite, no better than a prophane Epicure, he cannot endure a Devill though he be in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantell; and that becauſe they reſpect not the reward of vertue, but the regard of men; as if vertue were not a ſufficient recompence to it ſelfe. Happy is that man that can eſpy this curſed vice in himſelfe; happier that laboures by the power of God to purge it out. They that will have helpe againſt this ſpirituall wickedneſſe, muſt ſeeke unto God, and get directions out of his Word, which is mighty through<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 3</note> God to the pulling downe of ſtrong houlds. Praying dayly for the aſsiſtance of his<note place="margin">Eph. 6, 18.</note> Spirit, elſe it will not bee enough to fight with Gods weapons, unleſſe wee borrow his arme. The enemy of our Saluation is powerfull, and therefore called the god<note place="margin">Eph. 2, 2.</note> of this World, and the Prince that ruleth in the Aire: who laboures mightily to keepe us in league with our ſinnes. And therefore uſeth innumerable ſtratagems
<pb facs="tcp:17173:6"/> to hinder us in our journey, to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Canaan: Working either upon the corruption of our nature, to diſturbe us in the practiſe of Piety, or elſe by diſhart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of us under the croſſe, when wee ſhould be moſt reſolute for Gods glory: and therefore ſeeing he is ſo reſolute to worke our ruine, it ſhould make us carefull to<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 12.</note> worke out our owne ſalvation with feare and trembling, and give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure, and to<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 10</note> let our converſation be ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt; that ſo we may bee<note place="margin">Phil. 1, 27.</note> blameleſſe and harmeleſſe, the ſonnes of God without rebuke in the middeſt of a<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 15.</note> crooked and perverſe nation. Elſe if wee neglect the meanes of our ſalvation, and ſpend our daies in ſenſuality, carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity will ſeaze upon us, and then when we would caſt off theſe bonds, wee cannot, becauſe our Dalilahs; our own follies have beguiled us. Therefore ſeeing our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſo potent, and malicious, let us not<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5, 7</note> ſleepe as doe other, but let us watch and
<pb facs="tcp:17173:7"/> be ſober. Nature can teach men to care for thoſe things that concerne their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life; but it is grace that muſt teach men to minde thoſe things that concerne their ſpiritual life: &amp; ſeeing that upon the breath of our lives hanges two eternities, the one of endleſſe felicity, the other of eaſeleſse and endleſſe paines; what maner of perſons ought we to be paſsing the time of our pilgrimage heerein feare, and with <hi>Iob, 14. 14.</hi> to waite all the daies of our appointed time, till our change come? Happy will that ſervant bee whome his Maſter when hee commeth ſhall finde ſo doing. But leaſt I ſhould ſeeme <hi>monere memorem,</hi> more laborious than need re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quires, I ſurceaſe, deſiring you to accept of this ſimple ſcarce ripe fruit of theſe my Meditations, and to looke over my fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with an eye of compaſsion, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſlippes and infirmities with the mantell of Charity, for <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi> So ſhall I remaine thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you, and will endevour to provide

               <q>When the uncleane Spirit is gone out of a man, hee walketh through drie places, ſeeking reſt, and findeth none. Then he ſaith, I will returne into my houſe whence I came out, &amp; when he is come, he findeth it emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſwept, and garniſhed.</q>

               <p>OVr Saviour Chriſt in great humility and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, came to ſave and to ſeeke the loſt ſheepe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> unto whom hee came, not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17173:21"/> empty handed, neither did hee leade an unprofitable life among them: but all his workes were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his love, to their ſoules and bodies, in curing the one, and feeding the other; for <hi>he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>

               <p>Yet for all his manifold mercies &amp; manifeſt miracles w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he wroght among theſe ſtubborne Iewes, they requited him with inveterate hatred, and maliciouſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his workes, to be wrought by the power of the Divell; for ſo they ſay, <hi>This fellow doth not caſt</hi>

So that in this Story, the holy Evangeliſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17173:21"/> doth lay open a double conflict of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Saviour; the firſt is againſt Sathan the enemy of mankinde, in the body of a poore man; the other in the tongue of theſe obſtinate phariſes. In the one, he was a blinde &amp; dumb divell, in the other a ſeeing and perverſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie. Now, becauſe violence doth not make an enemy ſo dangerous as cunning and craftie: therefore our Saviour caſts him preſently out of the blinde and dumbe man. Where in he ſhewed himſelfe by force; but out of theſe ſubtill and malicious Phariſes, he did not ſo eaſily caſt him out, but is forced to come from ſound arguments (which might have ſtopt their mouths) to paſſe a doome upon them in the concluſion of<note place="margin">Verſ 45.</note> this Parable; <hi>Even ſo ſhalt it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to this wicked generation.</hi>

               <p>Whether theſe words were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the poore man, out of whom the divell was gone out, or to the ſtubborne Iewes, may ſeeme a Queſtion. No doubt but it may very fitly be applyed to the former, that having received ſo great a benefit, he ſhould not be unthankefull to the Lord for his deliverance, or grow ſecure and careleſſe; leaſt by his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and miſdemeanour, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill which now was caſt out of him, ſhould returne and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of him againe; and ſo his laſt end <hi>ſhould be worſe than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> Or elſe theſe words may ſerve to be a witneſſe againſt theſe perverſe Scribes and Phariſes, to ſeale up their further damnation: It may ſerve for both, and bee as a patterne for the godly to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; to teach them to order their ſpeech, that their words being weighed in the ballance of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17173:22"/> and powdered with the ſalte of diſcretion, may tend to <hi>edification, and miniſter grace to the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>When the uncleane ſpirit is gone out of a man.</hi> This uncleane ſpirit which keepes poſſeſſion by the power of ſinne, was after a ſort formerly caſt out of the Iewes, when they received the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo were taught to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God aright; then this uncleane ſpirit, with his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy troope, being deſtitute of ſo convenient a lodging, walked through drie places, amongſt the Gentiles to ſeeke reſt, whom hee corrupted in ſuch a vile manner, that hee made them leeſe both ſence and humanity, and fall into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17173:23"/> all manner of blindeneſſe and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as we may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. in ſo much, that being ſeduced by him, they worſhipped and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, with manifold Idolatries; ſo that at the laſt, hee had ſo farre infatuated their underſtanding, that they alſo worſhipped Catts, Serpents, and other filthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as may appeare by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of divers hiſtorians. <hi>Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi> (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> obſerves) ſaith, There was worſhipped upon the earth 30. thouſand gods. In which Idolatrie the Gentiles continued, untill the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> preached the truth of his Goſpel amongſt them; which glad tydings they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and forſooke their former errours, and beleeved in him, and when they ſaw his miracles, they ſpake very honourably of him, and acknowledged him to be Saviour of the world; of whom it was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17173:23"/> foretold by the Prophet, that <hi>He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 35. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould open the eyes of the blinde, and unſtop the eares of the deafe.</hi> Then Sathan this uncleane ſpirit, was forced to goe out of them alſo. But the Iewes, unto whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Saviour of the world was ſent, oppoſed and diſgraced him in his workes and miracles, and by all means laboured to withſtand him. Sathan finding this opportunity, returned backe againe unto theſe ſtubborne Iewes, whoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he found ſtuffed with a number of blinde Ceremonies and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall traditions, contrary to the Law of God. In the Temple, in ſtead of Paſtors to teach the word, he found Drovers &amp; Brokers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſale: In ſtead of pues for prayer, tables for Vſurers &amp; money changers; and in ſtead of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for the Saints, he found <hi>a denne of Theeves.</hi> Sathan I ſay,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17173:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> finding this opportunity, enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and houlds them in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance; ſo that their <hi>laſt end is worſe than their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> For, now they are deprived of their Temple and liberty, and are as vagabonds upon the face of the earth, as appeares this day. By which we may ſee, what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement all thoſe are liable unto, which oppoſe the grace of God, when it is offered unto them. They doe as much as in them lyes, lay themſelves open to the malice of Sathan; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained any opportunity, will hardly be driven from them.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſayd as much as is needefull for the underſtanding of this preſent Parable; yet, that we may receive the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, we will for methods ſake (which is memories guide) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the matter therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17173:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> under theſe foure heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee will ſhew the manner and the meaſure of Sathans depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the ſoule of man; and then how he demeaneth himſelfe, when he is gone.</p>

               <p n="3">3. When he hath regained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, how forciblie hee ſences himſelfe to prevent expulſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The miſerable eſtate of all thoſe hee repoſſeſſes, how and wherein their end is worſe than their beginning.</p>
               <p>Theſe 4. points by Gods grace ſhall be the ſubſtance of my enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, of which in their order. We will begin with the firſt, contayned in theſe words, <hi>When the uncleane ſpirit is gone out, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>In theſe words is contained the uncleane ſpirits departure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour when he is gone. This uncleane ſpirit is here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his eſſence, he is a ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his quality or condition, an uncleane ſpirit. He is a ſpirit. The word ſpirit in Scripture, ſometime doth ſignifie the eſſence of the god-head, as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>a Spirit.</hi>

                  <hi>Saul;</hi> that is, the Divell. And in this place he is called <hi>An uncleane ſpirit,</hi> whereby his nature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be uncleane. And thus much for his eſſence. He is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Come wee now to ſpeake of his quality and condition; <hi>He is uncleane.</hi> The divell is an uncleane ſpirit, but not in regard of his creation, but in reſpect of the condition hee brought upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The Scriptures teach, that the Divell was not created evill;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17173:26"/> For, <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>made, and behould it was very good.</hi> He was created an <hi>Angell of Light,</hi> and a ſpirit without mixture of body; immortall without feare of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; intellectuall with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding promptneſſe of wit; free that nothing could force his will, wiſe with fulneſſe of naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; powerfull above all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our creatures: wholy decked with admirable vertues; capable of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God clearely, with promiſe of this glory, if he perſevered in his ſervice. But not being content with this his eſtate, but ſeeking to pry into the majeſty of the deity,<note place="margin">Eſay 14. 12.</note> and to uſurpe the <hi>glory of his maker,</hi> was therefore dejected and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell; and ſo from being a bleſſed Angell in Heaven, he is become a damned devill in hell. As he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived his nature from God, ſo he is good; but this depravation of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17173:26"/> his nature is from himſelfe. An Angell he was of Gods making, &amp; a divell of his owne. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of the glory of God, he delights in all uncleanneſſe, &amp; is an utter enemie to all holineſſe. Therefore he uſeth all meanes to make mankinde as unhappie as himſelfe, and to wrappe every mothers Childe under the curſe of God. As ſoone as our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were ſet in Paradiſe; though they were furniſhed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible army of innocencie and righteouſneſſe, ſo that he was not able to conquer them by force and violence; yet out of an inveterate hatred which he bare to the Image of God ſhining in them, and out of envie to their happineſſe, hee entered into a treacherous parlie with our Grandmother <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo bewitched her ſences with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that he cauſed her to wandor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17173:27"/> from the truth of Gods Word; and to intice her husband to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe<note place="margin">Gen. 3, 16.</note> the <hi>Commandement</hi> of God; whereby they put off the Armour of innocencie and righteouſneſſe, and entertayned into their ſoules a troupe of his ambitious tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then having gayned the poſſeſſion he ſought for, preſently he ranſacked their ſoules, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of all ſpirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and brought them like inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Captives under his dominion. And that he might the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely keepe them under ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he did not onely kill and wound Gods graces in their ſoules, but in ſtead of them, hee placed a ſtrong Gariſon of carnall corruptions and fleſhly luſts, which ſhould be as a Porter to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen paſſage to his temptations, whenſoever he pleaſe to make any entrance. Thus having ſo poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>Firſt, for the manner of his going out; Sathan will not depart but by compulſion; for he keepes poſſeſſion like a ſtrong armed man, which will not be amooved, till a ſtronger, even the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come againſt him; he alone and none but he, can<note place="margin">Math. 17, 19,</note> maſter and ſubdue him. The diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were <hi>unable</hi> to doe it; and by his owne good will, he will never depart.<note place="margin">Math. 8, 29, Mark. 5. 7.</note> He loves his dwelling ſo well, that he accounts it no leſſe than a <hi>Torment to be caſt out.</hi> And ſo envious hee is to mankinde, that he will never leave him till hee have brought him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; becauſe he is greeved that mankinde ſhould enjoy that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he himſelfe hath loſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of the curſe that was given him in Paradiſe, that the ſeede of the woman <hi>ſhould bruiſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3 15.</note> 
                  <hi>his head.</hi> Therefore he purſues man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with deadly hatred and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17173:29"/> malice, that either he may fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of Gods word, or bring mankinde into perpetuall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Yet for all his power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, there is a time when he muſt be gon; and that is when the Lord by the powerfull working of his Spirit, diſpelleth the blindneſſe of nature, and the ſinfull corruptions thereof, out of the hearts of his children, and doeth inlighten them with the ſaving knowledge of himſelfe. This he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when by the miniſtery of the Law he convinceth their conſciences of ſinne; and ſheweth them the hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe and fearefulneſſe thereof, and then the grievous puniſhments due to them for the ſame; which are<note place="margin">Levit. 26.

And ſtirres up in them a care and conſcience, to uſe all good meanes whereby they may be aſſured that they ſhall have their part in the mercies of God, and in the merits of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Then God joyneth them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as the head unto the body, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17173:31"/> then as ſoone as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is joyned to them, they are made members of his body, who by his Spirit reneweth their will and affections, and frameth in them a ſpirituall life that they may <hi>ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe</hi>

                  <hi>all the dayes of their life.</hi> Thus the Lord by theſe meanes caſteth this uncleane ſpirit out of the hearts of his children, ſo that he ſhall never totally regaine his former poſſeſſion; for it is a certaine <hi>Maxime in Philoſophie, that two contraries cannot ſtand together at one time, in one and the ſame ſubject.</hi> There can be no agreement betweene light and darkeneſſe, God and Belial; but when grace comes in, vice muſt goe out.

               <p>Muſt Sathans power give place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> then examine thy heart and try thy wayes, whether this uncleane ſpirit be caſt out of thee or no? Thou muſt try it by the meanes which God uſeth to make entrance, and to take poſſeſſion of his children for his owne ſervice; which is by the miniſtery of the word of God. For when the fleſh with the luſts thereof are terrified with the canon ſhot of legall threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, making a great breach into the heart and conſcience, wounding and ſmiting it, for the breach of Gods Commandements; which workes feare and ſhame in the ſoule, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending

               <p>2. We may try whether this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit bee caſt out of us, by the reformation of our lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; for by vertue of the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the heart, Gods children are brought to a ſight of the danger of their naturall eſtate, and what neede they have of repentance and of Chriſt, and of inward purging from their corruptions. Regeneration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at repentance, and repentance begins when ſinne is forſaken; let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us then conſider our thoughts and actions, and try our ſanctification thereby: conſider I ſay,

Doeſt thou ſtrive by all meanes, to caſt out this uncleane ſpirit out of thy ſoule, whoſe power conſiſts in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, the maine pillar whereof is ignorance and unbeleefe? And doſt thou labour for knowledge and ſanctification, that thereby thou maiſt be enabled to yeeld obedience to all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of the Lord, though they croſſe thy nature, and curbe thee in thy profits and delights; yet for all this thou ſtriveſt to walke in all Gods ordinances without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,<note place="margin">Luk, 1, 75,</note> and doeſt ſo walke in thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards the world, as if Gods eye did alwayes behold thee, and were privie to all thy actions? Againe, doſt thou ſo carry thy ſelfe with reverence to the glorious majeſty of God, in thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17173:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> private devotions, as if the eye of man did alwayes behold thee? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou labour alſo to ſubvert the kingdome of Sathan in others? If thou bee a private man, in love and Charity, by exhortation to moove to good workes, ſhewing thy ſelfe by practiſe in obedience to God and<note place="margin">Tit. 2, 7,</note> the <hi>king; a patterne of all goodneſſe.</hi> If thou bee a Magiſtrate, to reſtraine from evill by the power of the ſword: If a Miniſter, to allure to vertue, by the power of the word, and unblama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converſation. Art thou troubled and greeved in thy minde, when thou meeteſt with hinderances and lets, whereby thou canſt not ſerve God, in ſuch manner as thou wouldeſt? And doſt thou carefully redeeme the time for thy ſoules good? Is it a vexation &amp; greefe for thee to live among ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as have not the feare of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and are careleſſe to uſe thoſe meanes wch God hath appointed for their ſalvation? If at any time thou

And then canſt thou more comfortably rejoyce in the favour of God, than in any earthly bleſſing whatſoever? Then if thou canſt finde theſe or the like markes of ſalvation in thy ſoule; then I pronounce unto thee out of the word of God, that this uncleane ſpirit is gone out of thee. For if hee held thee under his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, he would not ſuffer thee to take notice of thy darling ſinnes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to juſtifie thy ſelfe in thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.

               <p>This phraſe of ſpeech is uſed with other of like ſignification, as <hi>Heb. 10. 6. If wee ſinne willingly after wee have received the knowledge of the truth, there remayneth no more ſacrifice for ſinne.</hi> Againe the ſame

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17173:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſee this ſinfull world to bee full of trouble and vexation, and they feare that there will bee great bitterneſſe in death.</p>
               <p>Therefore hearing of a full delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by <hi>Chriſt</hi> from theſe dangers, they are content to yeeld obedience to the Word; but yet for want of the<note place="margin">Ioh. 5, 34,</note> ſappe of grace, this abides with them but for <hi>a ſeaſon.</hi> And ſo for all their outward conformity, they may bee rotten and unſound.

This uncleane ſpirit is ſo farre gone out of a man, as he lies hid and covered; Hee may keepe his hold, though he doe not ſhew himſelfe in hoſtile manner; he can transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light, and will make a ſhew of holineſſe, that he may doe the more wickedneſſe; he cares not though <hi>Abimelech</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <hi>Abraham</hi> and give him the beſt of his land, if he can but make him to commit adultery with his wife.

Hee cares not though <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah</hi> ſell their goods for the Churches good, if he can make them lye and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17173:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> wander after our profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then hee knowes he can wrap us under the curſe of the Lord, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his worke negligently. Hee will be content to bee expelled out of an ignorant heart, if ſo be he can corrupt his knowledge with faction and Schiſme. He can be content to bee caſt out in one ſinne, if he can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in another. He cares not if he be caſt out of an Idolatrous heart, if he can keepe poſſeſſion by prophane Atheiſme, then he hath as much as he deſires. And by this one ſin he markes them for his owne.</p>
               <p>5. This uncleane ſpirit may be caſt out in the opinion of the partie in whom he dwells, and not in the worlds account; for every man is ready to deceive himſelfe in this particuler, <hi>ſeeming</hi> pure in his owne eyes, though he be not waſhed from his <hi>filthineſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 30.</note> Let us ſee how nature occaſions this deceipt, and how many delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in thinking they are ſome<note place="margin">Gal. 6, 3,</note>

               <p n="1">1. Deceipt is to make a man thinke he is a good Chriſtian, becauſe hee leades a civill life, and is juſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his dealings. This is indeede an excellent vertue in it ſelfe, and a good ſtep to Chriſtianity, and it were to be wiſhed, that all Gods Children would be carefull to walke unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in reſpect of the world. But yet for all this, this Commendable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is made evill by accident, &amp; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a dangerous outward meanes to exclude grace. For civill honeſty, if it be ſevered from true piety, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but glorious iniquitie. For the ornament thereof is, to reſt in the performance of outward actions, as to deale juſtly and uprightly with their neighbours, and to be free from the reproachfull crimes of the world; Now here they reſt and thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good Chriſtians, though all this while they bee ignorant of the true
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17173:47"/> God, and the grounds of his worſhip. And in their honeſt dealing with men they ayme not at Gods glory, that by their unblameable converſation his name may be magnified; yet for all this, becauſe the world cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, they reſt contented with a probable errour of being in the ſtate of grace; and the rather becauſe they know that if they ſhould ſtep forwards in religion, and labour for inward ſanctification, they ſhould not onely ſtirre up againſt themſelves many thundring ſtormes and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous Cenſures of this ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world, but alſo from the bottome of hell, many diſturbances and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full temptations; therefore Sathan labours to keepe them in this eſtate, and perſwades them, that this civill righteouſneſſe will carry them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that God will exact this preciſe and ſtrict obedience at the hands of the Preachers and thoſe which are better learned than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17173:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> But theſe men muſt know, that though their workes make a glorious ſhew in the ſight of men, yet they are odious in Gods ſight, if they bee not done in obedience to his Commandements, and in zeale for his glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men will not be perſwaded they are ſo bad, as indeed they are. Will you ſee how this deceipt is alſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned? It is, becauſe they compare themſelves with thoſe that are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans outragious revellers, whom they doe excell in regard of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill moderation and morall cariage: now finding themſelves in a better condition, they are in their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Canonized Saints, and ſo neede no reformation. Thus it comes to paſſe, that the proud man will not be perſwaded, that hee hath a filthy <hi>Lucifer</hi> in him. The covetous man will not be perſwaded that <hi>Mammon</hi> rules in him. The fornicator and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer will not be perſwaded that <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeus</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:17173:48"/> a filthy and uncleane ſpirit reignes in him: The envious man will not be perſwaded that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> an irefull divell governes him.

               <p n="3">3 Many men deceive themſelves, becauſe upon ſome good motions of Gods Spirit, by the powerfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Word, their conſciences are awaked, and they brought to a ſight of their ſinnes, ſo that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

               <p>6. This uncleane ſpirit, may ſeeme to bee caſt out in the opinion of the godly, and not of the partie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus the Diſciples had a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Iudas,</hi> becauſe of his outward conformity to the word, and becauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17173:49"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> had put him in truſt with the bagge: therefore when our Saviour told them, that one of them ſhould betray him, they ſuſpected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rather than <hi>Iudas,</hi> and yet all this while <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew he would prove a Traitor to him, and a butcher to himſelfe, and <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe knew that he had a covetous, envious divel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Thus we have ſeene how farre an hypocrite may go by natures light, and how they may attaine to much knowledge, and ſo may ſhine in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion; and yet for all this gallop to hell under Sathans colours. And though they are well perſwaded of their owne eſtate, yet Gods Word doth diſcover, that they are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and are hoodwinked of Sathan to their owne deſtruction; Becauſe by the ſhining lampe of outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſtanding upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their nature, and their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie with the world, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves, of the benefit of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17173:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> godly admonition, which is a notable meanes ordayned of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme many deſperate ſinners, from their ſinfull courſes, and to bring them home by repentance. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they poſt off this to others which are more ſcandalous to the world, and ſo doe not feele that they ſtand in neede of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to purge them from their ſinnes; therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtrangers from the covenant of<note place="margin">Ephe. 2, 2,</note> promiſe, and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>And thus wee have ſeene the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Sathans going out of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; he ſo ſeemes to goe, as that he alwayes continewes.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17173:51"/> hurt us in our ſtates; and if hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us in our ſubſtance, then he will vex us in our good names and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; and caſt out floods of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt us; and if he cannot prevaile againſt us herein, then hee will deſtroy the fruits of the earth, fiſh in the Sea; and if he cannot hurt us in them, then hee will corrupt and infect the ayre, that thereby hee may infect our bodies with noyſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; and if God will not give him leave to annoy us in theſe or the like, then hee is ſayd to walke in dry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for he accounts all thoſe places dry and uncomfortable to him, in which he can doe no miſcheefe. And thus you have the ſence and meaning of the words.</p>

               <p>A ſecond property of the divell is to roare in his walke; ſo doth the talebearer, he roares like a Lyon, and bellowes like a bull; and rather than faile, if hee thinke hee ſhall not be heard, hee will tell his tale over and over, and deprave the truth, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <list>
                  <item>1. He relies upon his owne ſtrength.</item>
                  <item>2. Hee takes advantage of mans weakeneſſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Hee is able to doe much by his owne ſtrength, therefore he is called the God of this world and the Prince that ruleth in the ayre, and hath all wicked men at his becke and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, which daily hee muſters up to take part againſt God and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; he is the head of all Tyrants and wicked men, and makes them doe as <hi>Athaliah</hi> did, kill and perſecute the godly that hee may rule himſelfe: therefore this powerfull enemy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne ſtrength, and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers courage and fidelitie, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17173:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> that by one meanes or other he ſhall prevaile; and ſo deſperate and venturous, that he will returne to his houſe againe, nothing ſhall croſſe and hinder him. Good Lord, what will not Sathan doe? <hi>If thou O tryumphant Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, his malice is againſt thee and thy glory, and cannot abide that thou ſhouldſt be glorifyed by thy people; he hates thy worſhip, and therefore labours to defile it: therefore ſhew thy ſelfe ſtrong to perſerve thy children, and to ſave them from his malice, and to keepe them alwayes in thy feare.</hi> Seeing then Sathan is ſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent to doe miſchiefe; this muſt teach us to be watchfull and alwayes to ſtand upon our guard and be prepared to reſiſt his temptations: for as ſoone as one is gone hee will come with another; he will returne to his houſe one way or other; and what hee cannot effect by force, hee will performe by flattery. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times under the name of friend, he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17173:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> allures us to ſome one ſinne or other; thus hee ſtirred up <hi>Peter</hi> to move his maſter to pitty himſelfe, and not to die when he might live. So hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades many Miniſters of the word, to pitty themſelves, and not to weare out themſelves in Preaching and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, as many doe; telling them that many good Miniſters take their pleaſure, and yet diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie well enough. But in this caſe, we muſt ſay to him as our Maſter once: <hi>Get thee behind me Sathan,</hi> for thou<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> art an adverſarie and enemy to Gods glory, and his peoples ſalvation. And if hee cannot prevaile with friendly termes, then he perſwades them, they take too much upon them, the Lords people are holy enough, and that there needs not ſo much adoe. If hee cannot prevaile this way, then hee will ſee if he can make them proud of their gifts; ſo to make them rob God of his glory. He ſpends all his time in open rebellion againſt God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17173:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> his children. Hee workes wonderfully in the Children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2, 2.</note> Thus hee wrought upon the prophane heart of <hi>Eſau</hi> to ſell his birthright for a meſſe of pottage; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the covetous heart of <hi>Iudas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his maſter. As hee is cunning in his ſecret temptations, ſo hee is very craftie to delude the ſences by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects. Thus he deceived <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle; ſo in the time of ignorance he deceived many, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the corps of ſome dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, making them ſpeake what hee pleaſed. Thus we have ſeene the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our enemy, and how he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouldned by his owne ſtrength.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place wee are to ſee how our weakeneſſe gives him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: he obſerves our negligence and ſinfull backeſliding, therefore like a cunning thiefe, he often comes to view the houſe, and to ſpie out the weake places before he make any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he lookes whether we be fallen
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17173:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> into thoſe ſinnes which before wee made a ſhew of repentance, and when hee findes a man fallen into his old ſinnes againe, then behold a ſwept houſe for Sathan. He knowes our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what wee love, delight, and hate, and ſo fits his temptation according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus hee can make the covetous man dig to Hell for riches: The ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man to uſe many indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to climbe to honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The wanton to commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and adultery. With theſe ſugred baites he hath not onely deceived the wicked, as <hi>Achan, Gehazie, Saul, Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> but even Gods deare children, as <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</hi> and many in our dayes. Thus by knowing our nature hee provokes us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſinne, hee ſtirrs up the cholericke man to anger and revenge; the melancholy man to deſpaire, and diſtruſt, and to take things in the worſt ſence. So he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades all mankinde to ſinfull ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that they have time enough
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17173:78"/> to repent and amend their lives; and ſo wraps them under the curſe of God, before they are aware.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will returne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sathan he thinkes there is none ſo holy, but that he may pervert; hee knowes the juſt falles ſeven times a day, and therefore may take them tripping at one time or other; and make them abuſe the mercie of the Lord. Againe hee knowes that there is none ſo ſinfull, but that he may be converted, and therefore hee tempts all good and bad; and rather than he will faile of his temptations, he will raiſe up a tempeſt from all the foure corners of the world, as he did when he blew downe <hi>Iobes</hi> houſe and killed his children. If the <hi>Eaſt</hi> winde of proſperity cannot puffe up Gods children, hee will ſee what hee can doe by the weſt winde of adverſity; he labours alwayes and by all meanes to diſhonour God, and to bring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to ruine: and had not we neede
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17173:78"/> to ſtand upon our watch, and to take heede of ſecurity, leaſt he deale with us as <hi>Iael</hi> did with <hi>Siſera,</hi> naile us to the poſts of Hell before wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware? He alwayes ſtands armed, ſo let us; let us not then let our armour lie ruſtie, but by prayer buckle it on; let us alwayes keepe in our calling, and then we are under Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then we may bouldly crave his aſſiſtance. Let us remember wee have a craftie divell to deale withall, that will watch us at all turnes and times; he hath his tearmes and vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his goings and commings, though ſometime by Gods reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power he may ſtay away a long time, yet he will returne; therefore bee not ſecure, but prepare for his comming, he hath not done with us, he will by one meanes or other labour to get poſſeſſion, and therefore wee had neede to have a vigilant eye over all the parts and faculties of our ſoules and bodies, leaſt they become win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17173:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> to let in Sathan to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>And thus much for his courage and reſolution, contayned in theſe words, <hi>I will returne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or whither hee will returne. <hi>I will returne to my houſe.</hi> Sathan calls the hypocrites heart his houſe, and ſo it is indeed, but not by creation. So every man is Gods houſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 19. but by the wilfull refuſall of Gods mercies, they then become denns for Sathan to lodge in. Thus the proud mans heart is a houſe for <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> to lodge in. The Adulterers heart, an Inne for <hi>Aſmodius</hi> to rooſt in. The envious mans heart a Cage for <hi>Beelzebub</hi> to lurke in. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull mans heart is a pallace for <hi>Baalberith</hi> to domineere in.

If pride, malice and revenge knocke, we are ready to open, and willingly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17173:80"/> embrace them; but the motions of Gods Spirit wee chocke and grieve, and will not entertaine them; The Lord lay not our ſinnes to our charge.</p>

If he cannot be a king in heaven, he will reigne as a god in earth; and if he cannot reſt in the hearts of Gods Children, then he will dominere in the children of diſobedience; He had rather be in any place, than in hell; therefore he will conſider his future place, before hee will leave his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer habitation; hee would not goe<note place="margin">Math. 8, 31.</note> out of the man hee poſſeſſed, before hee had liberty to goe into the ſwine. He had rather be in the hogs, than no where. While hee is in earth, he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17173:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> others, but while hee is in hell he is tormented himſelfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like an envious wretch, he thinks hee finds reſt if hee can revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon mankinde, or any thing that belongs to man. Hee can finde no reſt in a Papiſt or Atheiſt, for hee knowes that their worme-eaten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences lackes nothing but ſearing with the hot Iron of Gods wrath; he is ſure enough of them, becauſe they are hardned in their prophaneneſſe, and ſo the cuſtome of ſinne hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the ſence of ſinne; yet for all this, if hee cannot prevaile againſt Gods Children, hee will to his old houſe againe, there he is like to have good entertainement, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, than to walke in dry places, where he findes ſo much reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Come we now to ſee what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement he findes; the houſe is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is, voyd of the graces of Gods Spirit; he findes the hypocrite after he is inlightened, fitter to receive him
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17173:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> than hee was before, hee findes the houſe empty. The Divell ſhall never want roome whereſoever hee comes; he ſhall not be troubled with inmates, nor with any thing which ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. There are many profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors now adayes, will caſt off good motions and the performance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good duties, to pleaſe Sathan and his Inſtruments, rather than they would be tearmed Puritans and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians. Lord lay not this ſinne to their charge.</p>
               <p>Hee findes it empty both of faith and good workes. Now this empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe proceeds from idleneſſe, which is the mother of all miſchiefe. An empty houſe is a cage for all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; So an idle man is a fit ſubject for Sathan to worke upon; he knowes God cannot endure idleneſſe, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it in the men of <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi>

Thus did <hi>David</hi> when he had ſinned againſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in giving way to ſinfull luſts and uncleanneſſe: ſo when he had deſired to drinke of the waters of <hi>Bethleem,</hi>

Thus the cunning men being converted by the preaching of the word and brought to repentance, burned their Bookes,<note place="margin">Act. 19, 19,</note> that were deere unto them, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon themſelves for their ſinne; by which they ſhewed, both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in their affections, and a juſt revenge in their actions: thus if men would judge themſelves, they ſhould<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 37.</note> not be judged of the Lord.

A ſwept houſe will not ſerve the turne, it muſt bee a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and contrite heart that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to dwell in. Let us then ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our ſinnes, and up with them by the rootes; downe with pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and all manner of ſinne that offends God and grieves our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; elſe we are but deceiptfull hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and garniſhed and ſwept houſes for Sathan.</p>

How many are there to bee found in our dayes, that thinke it an eaſie matter to be ſaved? But brethren deceive not your ſelves, theſe filthy ſoules which have beene defiled with ſo many ſinnes, will not be ſo eaſily cleanſed. We have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17173:84"/> wayes defiled our ſelves with vaine and unſanctified thoughts, many foule and unſavory words have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of our mouthes; and doth not this ſhew that wee have filthy ſoules? Againe, how many lewde and ſinfull acts have wee committed and doe commit from time to time? and will a ſmall repentance make amends for all theſe tranſgreſſions? No, no, there muſt be ſtriving and preaſſing to enter in at the ſtraight gate. The<note place="margin">Luk. 13, 24.</note> kingdome of heaven ſuffers violence and the violent take in by force. But alaſſe! how many of us ſit ſtill, ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves in our pleaſures and delights? If eating and drinking, ſwearing and ſwilling, would ſend us to heaven, there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would come thither. There are many alſo to be found, that when they are rebuked for their ſinnes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to amend their lives, they will give good words, and wiſh that they could doe as they ſhould, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17173:85"/> how few of many are willing to plucke up their ſinnes by the rootes? Many will uſe the broome of repentance in ſweeping the houſe of their ſoule lightly and ſuperficially; but they will leave ſtill behind their evill cuſtomes and wicked habit of ſinne which clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth faſt to them, and is as deare as their right eye. Wee ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that many griping Vſurers will hate adultery, make conſcience of ſwearing and forſwearing, &amp;c. theſe cobwebbes they will ſweepe away; but for the filthy habit, and wicked trade of Vſury, becauſe it is a gainefull ſinne, and brings them an eaſie life, the broome ſhall not come ſo farre. So againe, many Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers (though well monied) hate Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe it is unlawfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God, <hi>Pſal. 15. Ezek.</hi> 18: but for adultery their beloved ſinne, this dirte, this filth muſt remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwept. The like may bee ſaid of all other ſinnes. Thus hypocrites will
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17173:85"/> indent with God as if he kept a court of Faculties, to diſpence with their darling, their beloved ſinnes, which they are loath to forgoe. But brethren marke (I pray you) the policy of Sathan: If he can keepe but one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this ſpirituall temple, it ſhall ſuffice him, he knowes how to keepe poſſeſſion well enough; but brethren deceive not your ſelves, if the divell have any part in your heart, God will have none, he will not admit of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall; he will be, <hi>aut Caeſar aut nihil,</hi> he will have the whole, or elſe let the divell take all; therefore learne wee to uſe violence againſt our beloved ſinnes, and let the divell have no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſes to looke into our hearts, leſt he circumvent and ſurpriſe us before we are aware, as he hath and doth many, deceiving them daily with outward ſhewes and the leaves of religion, without ſubſtance and through-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the heart; but if we will be a ſwept houſe for the Lord, wee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17173:86"/> muſt caſt away all our ſinnes; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhewes will not delight him, he cannot endure a divell in <hi>Samuels</hi> Mantle.</p>

               <p>The houſe ſwept and garniſhed, is a ſimilitude borrowed from the uſe and cuſtome of men, who delight to have all things handſome, cleane and comely, when they are to entertaine their friends. But the divell hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in no ſuch matter, this uncleane ſpirit hee delights in all manner of filthineſſe, and all manner of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, nothing pleaſeth him better.</p>

When men have bidden farewell to God and all godlineſſe, then they are fit houſes for him, when the feare of God is choaked in mens hearts, and the remembrance of Gods
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17173:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> judgements is not before their eyes. When the houſe is ſwept from all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſſe and vertue, &amp; garniſhed with the damnable ſins of ſwearing, lying, &amp; all maner of wickednes then behold theſe are trimmed houſes for Sathan to rooſt in.</p>
               <p>Sathan delights to have his houſe garniſhed, that thereby hee might ſeeme Gods Ape; for God will have his houſe garniſhed, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: <hi>For this is the will of God, even our</hi>

               <p>Sathan will allow his ſervants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to make ſhew of ſanctity, that thereby they may doe the more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; and to pretend Religion in ſhew, that they may act wickedneſſe in ſubſtance. He is loath to diſcourage his ſervants, therefore he will gratifie them a little, &amp; ſometime give them the bridle in their hands. Thus hee was contented <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <hi>Abraham</hi> in the beſt of his land, and that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould be <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciple; he cared not, ſeeing he could allure the one to Adultery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the other to betray his Maſter.

He knew that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were covetous and worldly minded, and therefore if they ſhould bee puniſhed with want in the Wilderneſſe; hee knew they would remember their cattell in Egypt, and quickly come backe againe for them.

               <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the divell, who now will uſe him worſe than before; hee let him enjoy his pleaſures and his vanities before; but ſeeing him in any good moode, he feares leaſt hee get from him; he cannot endure that a man ſhould repaire to the place of Gods worſhip or converſe with good company; hee knowes, the power of the word and godly conference are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17173:101"/> to convert a deſperate ſinner; therefore if he can finde his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he will remoove him from all meanes whereby he might be ſaved; and harden his heart, and dead his affections, till hee hath plunged him under the wrath of God unrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſtate is worſe in regard of himſelfe, while he was mantled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the garment of piety, and was cloathed with the lambe skin of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, ſo long he injoyed a good eſtimation among the godly, and enjoyed the benefit of their prayers: but when his counterfeit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe appeares to be double wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as before his hypocriſie decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world, ſo now his Apoſtacy hath deceived himſelfe; therefore his eſtate is worſe.

               <p n="3">3. His eſtate is the worſe in reſpect of God, who will turne him out of his protection: when God ſeeth that he eſteemes the dung, huske and traſh of this world above him; then hee forſaketh his dwelling being ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly uſed, and will not let his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence any longer take charge of him, but let him wallow in his ſinnes with all greedineſſe; and ſo, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee goes from Gods mercy, the nearer hee comes unto his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

For if wee ſinne willingly, after that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 26, 27.</note> ſinnes, but a fearefull looking for of judgements and fiery indignation. Nothing doth ſo provoke the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God againſt men as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie doth. For a man to fall from riches to poverty, from honour to abaſement, is a matter of nothing; God loves a man never the worſe for his abaſement in the world, as may be ſeene in <hi>Iob</hi> on the dunghill, or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17173:103"/> but alſo the godly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them great reproach. For when a man falls from the profeſſion of the truth, the world ſees hee was but a painted hypocrite when he was at the beſt; hence it comes to paſſe that they looſe their honour, and their glory is turned into ſhame. And if ſhame reſted upon them alone, it were well; but their falls opens the mouths of prophane men to inſult and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and ſay, Theſe are your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and Scripture men, they are as bad as any are; therefore I will truſt none of them, for ſuch a mans ſake. Now if the ſpyes which brought an evill report upon the land of Canaan, were never ſuffered to enter into the land becauſe they diſcouraged the people; ſo the Apoſtate becauſe hee hath laid a ſtumbling blocke in Gods Childrens way, deſerves to bee ſhut out of the Lords reſt, whereof the land of Canaan was a type.

If Chriſt have waſhed thee in his blood, bathed thee in his wounds, and cured thee with his ſtripes, and tooke off this burthen from thy ſhoulders; take heede of lading thy ſelfe againe by new tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, but if thou be made whole, ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<note place="margin">Ioh, 5, 14,</note> unto thee.</p>

Take heed of ſinne in generall, ſo in a ſpeciall manner; take heed of vilifying the worke of grace that ſhines in Gods ſervants, and is made evident to your conſciences by the word or worke of God. This was the fearefull ſinne of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that daily ſaw the divine power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhining in their conſciences, yet they did oppoſe themſelves againſt him, and charged him that hee borrowed
